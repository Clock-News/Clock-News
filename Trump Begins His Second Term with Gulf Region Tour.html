<h1><strong>Trump Begins His Second Term with Gulf Region Tour</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Three-Day Trip Across the Middle East</strong></h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has started his first international trip of his second term by visiting three important countries in the Gulf region: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

<h2><strong>Trip Schedule</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monday</strong>: Leaves the United States</li>
  <li><strong>Tuesday</strong>: Arrives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Attends a Gulf summit and travels to Qatar</li>
  <li><strong>Thursday</strong>: Finishes his tour in the UAE</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Main Goals of the Visit</strong></h2>
<p>Trump’s trip focuses on boosting the economy and improving diplomatic ties. Key issues include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A possible ceasefire in Gaza</li>
  <li>Progress on peace talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel</li>
  <li>Greater security cooperation among Gulf countries</li>
</ul>
<p>He may also announce whether the US will continue calling the sea between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula the "Persian Gulf" or change it to the "Arabian Gulf".</p>

<h2><strong>Saudi Arabia: Business Deals and Peace Efforts</strong></h2>
<p>Trump is encouraging Saudi Arabia to join the <strong>Abraham Accords</strong>, which helped normalize Israel's relations with the UAE and Bahrain during his first term. Talks were delayed due to the Gaza conflict, but Trump might present a new peace plan.</p>
<p>Unlike President Biden, Trump is not linking Saudi Arabia’s nuclear energy plans to peace with Israel. Saudi Arabia is asking for US support to build a peaceful nuclear program.</p>
<p>Trump also wants to lock in a <strong>$1 trillion investment</strong> from Saudi Arabia in US businesses, adding to the $600 billion already pledged by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is also expected to announce <strong>over $100 billion in weapons purchases</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Missiles</li>
  <li>Radar equipment</li>
  <li>Transport planes</li>
</ul>
<p>Talks may restart on updating the <strong>US-Saudi defense agreement</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>UAE: Technology and AI Collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>Trump will meet UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed to discuss a huge <strong>$1.4 trillion investment plan</strong> focused on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
  <li>Semiconductors</li>
  <li>Energy</li>
  <li>Manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>Trump is also expected to lift restrictions placed during Biden’s term on high-tech US exports to the UAE. This will help the UAE achieve its goal of becoming a global leader in AI by 2031.</p>

<h2><strong>Qatar: Military and Middle East Conflicts</strong></h2>
<p>In Qatar, Trump will meet Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. They will talk about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strengthening military cooperation (Qatar hosts the largest US base in the region)</li>
  <li>Improving regional security coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>Qatar may ask the US to ease sanctions on Syria and will likely bring up the ongoing Gaza ceasefire talks, as Qatar plays a key mediating role in the region.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Trump Isn’t Visiting Israel</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the rising violence in Gaza and tensions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Trump has decided not to visit Israel on this trip.</p>
<p>Reports say there is growing <strong>mistrust between Trump and Netanyahu</strong>, and Trump is aiming for a more <strong>independent approach</strong> to Middle East policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Reaction from the Region</strong></h2>
<p>All three countries — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE — have promised <strong>major investments</strong> in the US ahead of Trump’s visit, showing signs of strong cooperation.</p>
<p>However, Trump’s earlier idea of moving Gaza residents to other Arab countries received <strong>strong criticism</strong>. Egypt, Qatar, UAE, and Kuwait rejected it, saying they support the right of Palestinians to stay in their own land.</p>
