<p>More than 100 Palestinians, including many women and children, were<br>
killed in new Israeli airstrikes across Gaza. The attacks happened<br>
as Palestinians marked the 77th anniversary of the Nakba – the mass<br>
displacement of over 750,000 Palestinians during the creation of Israel<br>
in 1948.</p>
<br>
<p>At least 59 people died overnight in Khan Younis, a city<br>
in southern Gaza. Local doctors say most of the victims<br>
were children and families. In the north, airstrikes also<br>
hit Gaza City and Jabalia.</p>
<br>
<p>Al Jazeera’s reporter, Tareq Abu Azzoum, called it<br>
“another bloody day” and said Israeli jets hit nine<br>
homes in Khan Younis without warning. Many families were<br>
completely wiped out. He said the attacks seemed to<br>
target civilians, not military sites. In Jabalia, 13<br>
raids hit the refugee camp and nearby areas while<br>
people were sleeping.</p>
<br>
<p>Rescue teams are overwhelmed and short on equipment<br>
to help those trapped under rubble. Abu Azzoum said<br>
the bombings are tearing apart Gaza’s social fabric,<br>
not just buildings.</p>
<br>

<h2><strong>Thousands Flee Their Homes</strong></h2>
<br>
<p>Following the attacks, thousands of people were forced<br>
to flee Gaza City after the Israeli army gave sudden<br>
evacuation orders. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported<br>
scenes of chaos, with families rushing to escape,<br>
carrying what little they could.</p>
<br>
<p>“There’s no safe place,” he said. “Even shelters<br>
have been bombed.”</p>
<br>
<p>One displaced man, Hasan Moqbel, called the situation<br>
a war on civilians. “They’ve been bombing Gaza for<br>
19 months. There are no fighters here – just children<br>
and old people dying,” he said.</p>
<br>
<p>People in Gaza are especially fearful on Nakba Day,<br>
worried that Israel may launch a bigger ground<br>
attack. “They’re scared of being forced to flee again,<br>
to even worse conditions,” said Abu Azzoum.</p>
<br>
<p>Despite international efforts to stop the violence,<br>
the attacks are only increasing.</p>
<br>

<h2><strong>Qatar Calls for Ceasefire – Trump Suggests U.S. Control Gaza</strong></h2>
<br>
<p>In Qatar, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani urged<br>
U.S. President Donald Trump to help push for a<br>
ceasefire.</p>
<br>
<p>“Our diplomacy is focused on stopping the bloodshed<br>
and freeing hostages,” he said. He warned that the war<br>
is threatening stability in the whole region – from<br>
the West Bank to Yemen and Lebanon.</p>
<br>
<p>Trump responded by sharing his own idea: for the U.S.<br>
to take control of Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone.”<br>
He said he would be proud if the U.S. led the rebuilding.</p>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff told Al Jazeera<br>
he felt hopeful about reaching a deal for Gaza that<br>
could include food, medical aid, and possibly a ceasefire.</p>
<br>

<h2><strong>Israeli Minister Calls for West Bank Assault</strong></h2>
<br>
<p>In the West Bank, things are also getting worse.<br>
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich<br>
called for destroying Palestinian towns, just like what’s<br>
happening in Gaza.</p>
<br>
<p>“Just like we are flattening Gaza, we need to<br>
flatten terror hubs in the West Bank,” he said,<br>
pointing to the village of Bruqin.</p>
<br>
<p>On Thursday morning, Israeli forces raided several<br>
cities and refugee camps across the West Bank –<br>
including Nablus, Bethlehem, and others. People reported<br>
arrests, home invasions, and mistreatment by soldiers.</p>
<br>
<p>With both Gaza and the West Bank under attack,<br>
many Palestinians are losing hope that any part<br>
of their homeland will be left untouched.</p>
