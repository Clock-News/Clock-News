<h2><strong>Three-Day Trip to the Gulf Region</strong></h2>
<p>President Donald Trump is beginning his first official overseas visit of his second term with a tour of three Gulf countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

<h2><strong>Trip Schedule</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monday: Departs the United States</li>
  <li>Tuesday: Arrives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</li>
  <li>Wednesday: Attends Gulf summit and visits Qatar</li>
  <li>Thursday: Concludes visit in the UAE</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Main Goals of the Trip</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Economic Deals and Regional Diplomacy</strong></h3>
<p>Trump aims to strengthen economic ties and make progress on key diplomatic issues, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ceasefire in Gaza</li>
  <li>Saudi-Israel normalisation talks</li>
  <li>Regional security cooperation</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Focus on the "Gulf" Naming Debate</strong></h3>
<p>Trump may announce a decision on how the US officially refers to the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula — whether to keep calling it the "Persian Gulf" or switch to "Arabian Gulf".</p>

<h2><strong>Saudi Arabia: Major Business Deals and Diplomacy</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Revival of Abraham Accords</strong></h3>
<p>Trump wants Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel's ties with the UAE and Bahrain during his first term. Talks had stalled due to the Gaza war, but Trump may propose a new peace plan.</p>

<h3><strong>Nuclear Deal Unlinked from Israel</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike Biden’s policy, Trump is not tying Saudi nuclear cooperation to Israeli normalisation. Riyadh seeks US help in building a civilian nuclear program.</p>

<h3><strong>$1 Trillion Investment Target</strong></h3>
<p>Trump aims to secure a $1 trillion Saudi investment in US industries, building on a $600 billion promise already made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>

<h3><strong>Arms Sales Expected</strong></h3>
<p>Saudi Arabia is likely to announce over $100 billion in arms purchases, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Missiles</li>
  <li>Radar systems</li>
  <li>Transport aircraft</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>US-Saudi Defense Pact</strong></h3>
<p>Talks may resume to revise and revive a defense agreement between the two countries.</p>

<h2><strong>UAE: Tech Investment and AI Partnership</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>$1.4 Trillion UAE Investment Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Trump will meet UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, focusing on joint projects in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
  <li>Semiconductors</li>
  <li>Energy</li>
  <li>Manufacturing</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Lifting Export Restrictions</strong></h3>
<p>Trump is expected to remove Biden-era bans on US tech exports to the UAE, helping the country achieve its goal of becoming a global AI leader by 2031.</p>

<h2><strong>Qatar: Military Base, Syria, and Gaza Talks</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Strategic Military Alliance</strong></h3>
<p>Trump will meet Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Military cooperation (Qatar hosts the largest US base in the region)</li>
  <li>Security coordination</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Talks on Syria Sanctions</strong></h3>
<p>Qatar may ask the US to ease sanctions on Syria, where it has close ties with the new president.</p>

<h3><strong>Gaza Ceasefire Role</strong></h3>
<p>As a regional mediator, Qatar will likely raise Gaza ceasefire efforts during talks.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Is Trump Not Visiting Israel?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Rising Gaza Tensions</strong></h3>
<p>Due to escalating violence in Gaza and strained ties with Israeli PM Netanyahu, Trump is skipping Israel this time.</p>

<h3><strong>US-Israel Mistrust</strong></h3>
<p>Reports suggest growing distrust between Trump and Netanyahu, as Trump signals a more independent Middle East policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Regional Response to the Visit</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Investments Signaling Cooperation</strong></h3>
<p>All three countries — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE — have pledged major investments in the US ahead of Trump’s visit.</p>

<h3><strong>Pushback on Gaza Resettlement Proposal</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier, Trump proposed relocating Gaza residents to other Arab nations. This was rejected by countries like Egypt, Qatar, UAE, and Kuwait, who emphasized support for Palestinian self-determination.</p>
